## 2. Annotation quality

Complete the following tasks:
a) Calculate the accuracy between you and the other annotator, how often did you agree?
b) Now implement Cohenâ€™s Kappa score, and calculate the Kappa for your annotation sample. In which range does you Kappa score fall?
c) Take a closer look at the cases where you disagreed with the other annotator; are these disagreements due to ambiguity, or are there mistakes in the annotation?

**Solution**
See the implementations in `scripts.py`. TODO: b and c.
